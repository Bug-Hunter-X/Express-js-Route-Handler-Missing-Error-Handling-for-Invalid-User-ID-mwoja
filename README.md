# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route attempts to parse the `id` parameter as an integer without checking for potential errors. If the ID is not a valid integer, the application may crash or return an unexpected response.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with appropriate error handling.

## Bug
The primary issue is the missing error handling when converting the `req.params.id` to an integer. If `req.params.id` is not a valid integer, `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, and the `users.find` method might not work as expected, resulting in an error or unexpected behavior.
